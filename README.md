# Cryptoanarchy TODO
This list collects ideas to further develop or work on that further the cause of cryptoanarchy and give people sovereignty. It was inspired by an [article by smuggler](http://opaque.link/post/future-security-todo/) ([archive](https://archive.md/AP0k1)) (and contains some copypasta from there). Please help to improve it by opening PRs. There should probably be sub-pages for certain topics going into more detail. Maybe there should also be a tag system to later make the list filtereable for maturity of ideas and other aspects.

## Commerce
* Low trust all-or-nothing escrow systems
* Contract and evidence registries
* Disposable anonymous identities with biography
* Uncloneable, attestable, updateable ownership tags

## Privacy
* Anti-Biometrics and Privacy Enhancing Clothing


### Mixnets
While there exist production grade (which?) mixnets for high latency communication such as E-Mail, low-latency networks trading efficiency for latency seem to be still in their infancy.

* [mixnetworks.org](https://mixnetworks.org/): link list
* [Nym](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/): early development, loopix based
* [Katzenpost](https://github.com/katzenpost/katzenpost)

### E-Cash
Traditional e-cash systems haven't seen much interest since Bitcoin came along, but are making a comeback lately especially as federated systems. Notable examplex include [SCRIT](https://github.com/scritcash) and [MiniMint](https://github.com/fedimint/minimint). None are production ready so far.

* [SCRIT](https://github.com/scritcash/scrit): federated e-cash without built-in backing
* [MiniMint](https://github.com/fedimint/minimint): federated e-cash system with Bitcoin backing
* [OpenTransactions](https://opentransactions.org): supports some form of e-cash, quite active repository but unclear if deployed anywhere

## Infrastructure
### Hosting
* Decentralized, machine-payable hosting on trusted hardware would be very interesting to have. Applications could deploy themselves and stay "alive" as long as they have positive cash flow.

### Logistics
* Drone mix routing
* Physical transferable storage

### Networking
* Interruption tolerant networking
* Long range unidirectional networking

## Physical Security
### Perimeter Suveillance

### Defensse
* Defensive architecture
* Modular, hypermobile and embedded container villages
* Short-range, remotely controllable kinetic anti-material defense stations

#### Non-lethal Weapons
* Non-lethal, high-manstop, self-defense weapons

#### Lethal Weapons
Quite mature projects exist already:

* [FGC-9](https://odysee.com/@TheGatalog-HybridDesigns:0/FGC-9_MkII_Rev1:f): 9mm gun design possible to manufacture in Europe without restricted parts
* [Gatalog](https://thegatalog.com/): more gun designs and technical documentation
